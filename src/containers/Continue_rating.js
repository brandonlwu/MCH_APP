              Great!
              <br /><br /> You have completed the practice trials. Now onto the real test.
              <br /><br />  It is important to note that the tone in the practice session was there to make sure
              <br /><br />  you understood what to do, with very obvious and impossible-to-hear tones.
              <br /><br />  The tone in the remainder of the experiment
              <br /><br />  may be very difficult to hear so you will have to listen very hard.
              <br /><br />  Sometimes it might be difficult to answer, but if you do not know, please guess.
              <br /><br />  For this first task, you will not be asked to rate your confidence so just quickly press
              <br /><br />  and release the button as soon as the screen flashes with the diagonal red stripes.
              <br /><br /> Press  <font size="+2">  <b> "Q"/YES </b> </font> if you <b> DO </b>hear the tone.
              <br /><br /> Press <font size="+2"> <b> "E"/NO </b> </font> if you <b> DO NOT </b> hear the tone.
              <br /><br /> Please respond as <b> QUICKLY </b> and as <b> ACCURATELY </b> as you <b> POSSIBLY CAN </b>
              <br /><br /> There will be scheduled breaks throughout the experiment, but please do not take a break unless instructed.
              <br /><br /><br /> PRESS "Q"/YES TO BEGIN THE EXPERIMENT.
